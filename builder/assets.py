"""
This file is responsible for handling and resolving asset paths, like images.

Its main purpose is to take an image reference from a Markdown file (e.g.,
`![[image.png]]` or `![](../graphics/image.png)`) and resolve it to a
normalized, relative path that will be valid in the final static site. This
is a critical step for ensuring images render correctly.

    Resolves an image reference and normalizes it for the output HTML.

    It takes a raw image reference string, resolves its absolute path using
    `resolve_asset_reference`, and then calculates the relative path from the

    Finds the absolute path of an asset based on Obsidian's resolution rules.

    The resolution logic is as follows:
    1. Check for a relative path from the source file's directory.
    2. If it's a simple filename, check within the same directory.
    3. If not found, search in a 'graphics' subdirectory of the current
       directory and all ancestor directories up to the vault root.

    Args:
        ctx: The build context.
        source_dir: The directory of the Markdown file referencing the asset.
        reference: The raw string reference to the asset.
