# Executive Summary

This vault exporter demonstrates how to transform an Obsidian workspace into a SPA without server-side code.

Key findings:

- Build metadata drives breadcrumbs, sidebar entries, and alias resolution.
- Markdown is converted with a lightweight parser implemented in `build.py`.
- The front-end rewrites wiki links and relative paths on the fly.
