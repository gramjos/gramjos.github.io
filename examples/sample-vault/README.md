# Sample Vault

Welcome to the demo vault used to validate the static Obsidian-style site generator.

- Explore the [[Projects]] directory for work-in-progress material.
- Meet the team on the [[About|About This Space]] page.
- Review the [project spec](projects/spec.md) rendered as a standalone note.

```python
from datetime import datetime

print("Generated on", datetime.now().isoformat())
```

## Getting Around

Use the breadcrumb trail at the top of the Single Page App to retrace your steps.

1. Start at the Root crumb.
2. Dive into folders such as Projects.
3. Select any note to display it instantly without a full reload.

Enjoy the build!
