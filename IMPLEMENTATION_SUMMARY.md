# Implementation Summary: Excalidraw Support

This document summarizes the changes made to add Excalidraw drawing embed support to the static site generator.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (Python) - `build.py`

#### Modified `MarkdownConverter` class:

- **Updated `replace_wiki_image()` function** (lines ~281-295): 
  - Added detection for `.excalidraw` and `.excalidraw.md` file extensions
  - When detected, generates a `<div class="excalidraw-embed" data-excalidraw-target="..."></div>` instead of an `<img>` tag
  - Still tracks the embed as a local link for asset resolution

#### Modified `PageRecord` dataclass:

- **Added `excalidraw_data` field** (line ~41):
  - New optional field of type `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]`
  - Stores the extracted Excalidraw JSON data

- **Updated `as_dict()` method** (lines ~58-60):
  - Includes `excalidrawData` in the output when present

#### Modified `VaultBuilder` class:

- **Added `_extract_excalidraw_json()` static method** (lines ~614-632):
  - Extracts JSON data from code blocks in `.excalidraw.md` files
  - Looks for ````json` code blocks
  - Validates that the JSON contains Excalidraw data (`elements` or `type` field)
  - Returns the parsed JSON object or `None` if not found

- **Updated `_process_markdown_file()` method** (lines ~460-510):
  - Detects if a file is an Excalidraw file based on extension
  - Calls `_extract_excalidraw_json()` for Excalidraw files
  - Sets `page_type` to `"excalidraw"` for Excalidraw files
  - Passes `excalidraw_data` to the `PageRecord` constructor

### 2. Test Files

#### Created test files in `examples/sample-vault/projects/`:

- **`System Architecture.excalidraw.md`**:
  - Sample Excalidraw file with JSON data in a code block
  - Contains a rectangle and text element
  - Demonstrates the format expected by the parser

- **`overview.md`**:
  - Sample markdown file that embeds the Excalidraw drawing
  - Uses the syntax: `![[System Architecture.excalidraw.md]]`
  - Validates that the embed is correctly converted to a div

### 3. Documentation

#### Created `EXCALIDRAW_INTEGRATION.md`:

- Comprehensive guide for frontend integration
- Explains the backend changes
- Provides conceptual JavaScript code using React and `@excalidraw/excalidraw`
- Includes installation, setup, and usage instructions
- Shows how to render drawings in view-only mode
- Provides CSS styling recommendations
- Includes troubleshooting tips

#### Created `.gitignore`:

- Prevents committing Python cache files and other artifacts

## How It Works

### Backend Processing

1. **Detection**: When the `MarkdownConverter` encounters `![[filename.excalidraw.md]]` or `![[filename.excalidraw]]`, it recognizes it as an Excalidraw embed.

2. **Placeholder Generation**: Instead of creating an `<img>` tag, it generates:
   ```html
   <div class="excalidraw-embed" data-excalidraw-target="filename.excalidraw.md"></div>
   ```

3. **JSON Extraction**: When processing a `.excalidraw.md` file, the script:
   - Reads the markdown content
   - Looks for a ````json` code block
   - Parses the JSON content
   - Validates it contains Excalidraw data

4. **Data Storage**: The extracted JSON is stored in `site-data.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "projects/System Architecture.excalidraw.md",
     "type": "excalidraw",
     "excalidrawData": {
       "type": "excalidraw",
       "elements": [...],
       "appState": {...}
     }
   }
   ```

### Frontend Rendering (Conceptual)

The frontend implementation (not included in this PR, but documented) would:

1. Find all `<div class="excalidraw-embed">` elements on the page
2. Read the `data-excalidraw-target` attribute
3. Look up the corresponding page in `site-data.json`
4. Extract the `excalidrawData` from the page
5. Use React and the `@excalidraw/excalidraw` component to render the drawing in view-only mode

## Example Usage

### In Obsidian Vault:

1. Create a drawing file: `My Diagram.excalidraw.md`
2. The file should contain a ````json` code block with Excalidraw data
3. Embed it in another note: `![[My Diagram.excalidraw.md]]`
4. Run the build: `python build.py vault -o docs`

### Generated Output:

The embedding page will contain:
```html
<div class="excalidraw-embed" data-excalidraw-target="My Diagram.excalidraw.md"></div>
```

The `site-data.json` will contain the full drawing data for rendering.

## Testing

All functionality has been tested:

✅ Excalidraw JSON extraction from markdown files  
✅ Detection of `.excalidraw.md` embeds  
✅ Detection of `.excalidraw` embeds  
✅ Regular images are not affected  
✅ Excalidraw embeds with aliases work correctly  
✅ Full build process with sample files succeeds  
✅ Generated `site-data.json` contains correct data structure  

## Files Changed

- `build.py` - Core implementation
- `examples/sample-vault/projects/System Architecture.excalidraw.md` - Test file
- `examples/sample-vault/projects/overview.md` - Test file with embed
- `EXCALIDRAW_INTEGRATION.md` - Frontend integration guide
- `.gitignore` - Ignore Python cache files
- `docs/site-data.json` - Updated with test data

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation on a live site:

1. Install React and @excalidraw/excalidraw: `npm install react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw`
2. Create the `excalidraw-renderer.js` module (see `EXCALIDRAW_INTEGRATION.md`)
3. Update `app.js` to call `initializeExcalidrawEmbeds()` after rendering pages
4. Add CSS styling for the Excalidraw containers
5. Test in a browser to ensure drawings render correctly

## Notes

- Drawings are rendered in **view-only mode** (not editable)
- All data is embedded in `site-data.json` (no additional HTTP requests)
- Fully compatible with static hosting (GitHub Pages, etc.)
- The `<div>` placeholder may be wrapped in a `<p>` tag, which is technically invalid HTML but works in all browsers
